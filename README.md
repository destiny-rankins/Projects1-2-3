This project is an exploratory data analysis on the smoking cessation. The externalizing, substance abuse and internalizing behaviors of parent and children are examined by smoking status. The different smoking statuses include parents that smoked during three trimesters of pregnancy, smoked postpartum, and were exposed to smoke. A R mardown file is included.
